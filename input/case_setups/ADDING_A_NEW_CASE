* The basics of adding a new case for clubb (single-column mode CLUBB)
* 
********************************************************************************

The document is intended to give some basic pointers on adding new cases to the
code, but is by no means a complete reference.  The README file in this
directory serves as more of a reference for the namelist files (those files 
with the suffix of _model.in)

1. Start with a template
Begin by starting with a prior case with similar characteristics to the one
you are attempted to implement in the CLUBB code.  More recent cases are 
generally better than older ones, because the code has become more flexible in
recent years and requires less modification to source code to setup a new case.
The gabls3 case is an excellent example of a case that specifies the initial
sounding and forcings in text files rather than having them hardwired in the
source code.
The clubb hydrostatic code supports 3 different temperature variable as noted
in sounding.in files.  The convention of CLUBB is to use MKS units for all 
variables, but code from external contributors may not follow that convention.

2. Will you need any special external code?
CLUBB has an analytic and an interactive radiation scheme (BUGSrad) and multiple
microphysics packages that can be used to setup a new case.  Generally case
specifications will specify if these are needed and how to set parameters for
these schemes.
CLUBB can also use Latin Hypercube sampling of the PDF to drive a microphysics
scheme (i.e. it can account for subgrid scale variability of temperature, 
moisture, and vertical velocity for the purposes of predicting rain, snow and 
ice).  For a warm phase cloud example of this see rico_silhs and for a 
mixed-phase cloud see mpace_b_silhs.  Our correlations appear in a file named
<case name>_corr_array_below.in and <case name>_corr_array_cloud.in;  the values
come from various LES simulations and are approximate, since the actual values
will vary in and out of cloud and with time.
In order to prevent cooling spikes at the top of the atmosphere CLUBB implements
a buffer in the BUGSrad code that creates additional layers in the upper
atmosphere above the computational domain.  These additional layers can either
come from the sounding.in file or they can be drawn from a McClatchey standard
atmosphere table (based on average values worldwide).  See the cloud feedback
cases for an example of how to use the sounding data for this.

3. Will there be any special initialization required?
The code in module clubb_driver and subroutine clubb_initialize contains several
examples of setting the initial TKE for intercomparison cases.  Other variables
(e.g. initial cloud droplet number concentration) are specified in namelists.
Complete lists of these options are found in the README in this directory.

4. Does the current code have all the terms needed for the new case?
The clubb_standalone currently has code for forcing the mean fields, nudging
the wind profiles and sponge layer damping, but new cases may require a new
flag and code modifications.

5. Does the case require any new variables?
New passive scalars for example will likely require additional code.  The 
current code does not have a general means for adding source and sink terms
for the passive scalars without code modification.  The Cobra case provides
a template for adding new variables like this (see code related to sclr_CO2).
