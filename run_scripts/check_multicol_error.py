# Description: Compare 2 multicolumn standalone netcdf files.
#              Used to help determine if an error has been introduced in 
#              clubb_standalone. It's reccomended to only use this test
#              for arm/bomex, as they are the most stable cases, but it can
#              be used for any clubb cases.
#   
# Usage: Checkout a clean version of clubb with multicolumns enabled by setting 
#        namelist variables in clubb/input/tunable_parameters/configurable_model_flags.in
#
#               $configurable_multi_column_nl
#               num_standalone_columns = # of columns to run
#
#        Then clubb_standalone will output the netcdf data to ../output/case_multicol.nc
#        which should be saved for comparison somewhere (say save_case_multicol.nc). Then make 
#        changes to clubb source code, compile and rerun the case with the same number of 
#        standalone_columns, then compare the output files by calling this script with 
#
#           ./check_multicolumn_error.py save_case_multicol.nc ../output/case_multicol.nc
#
#        It's assumed that the largest single difference of any field, over any timestep/level/column,
#        will be less than 1.0e-7. For more stable cases like arm and bomex the largest difference is 
#        usually much smaller than 1e-7, but the tolerance has been relaxed for mpace_b, which is noiser,
#        but seems to be the least noisey case where ice develops.
